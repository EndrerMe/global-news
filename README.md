### Usage

The website uses free APIs to display the most popular news on the home page and upload articles in accordance with every category specialisation as well as usersâ€™ search requests. They also allow making conversions of required currencies and showing the weather data.

To determine geolocation and provide users with actual maps we have integrated Mapbox Maps to the website. Global News includes news subscription for all articles or a specific category so that users can receive daily news reports on their emails.
